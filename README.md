MovieMongo
==========

MovieMongo is a small web application based on MongoDB. It manages movies which
are integrated from different datasources (like DBPedia, freebase or IMDB).
Users can register and add movies to their personal movies list. The backend
acts as a caching layer for search requests and builds same-as links based on
given information.

Movies are integrated refering to a canonical schema. Additional information is
also stored. User can add own information by using simple key-value data fields.

The project was developed during a practical course at the University of Leipzig
in 2012/13. Our goal was to work with different linked open data sources and
MongoDB as a storage layer for unstructured data.
